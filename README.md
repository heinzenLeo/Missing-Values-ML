# Missing-Values-ML

## About:
I programmed nan_columns.py aiming to help those who work with ML (Machine Learning). It is a really simple piece of code, but helps a lot.
The function nan_columns(), within the mentioned file, turns anyone's life easier, since you don't have to search for NaN values (missing values) anymore.
Just input your training and testing data with the features/predictors (X_train and X_test) and be happy!
Information about NaN values in your data will be shown.

## How to use:
- Download nan_columns.py and add it to your coding environment.
- In your main file, the one you're working, or of your preference, import the function nan_columns() from nan_columns.py --> example: from nan_columns import nan_columns
- Then input your X_train and X_test data (preferably in that order).
- The function will show you, in detail, everything about columns with nan values.
- I still highly recommend you seeing the example.md or example.ipynb in order to understand how to use it in real-life problems.

## Warnings:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your coding environment: *pandas*, *inspect*.

Both of your X_train and X_test data must be DataFrame type.

If any error is found, please contact me.
